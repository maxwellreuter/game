A 3D Java game engine!

## Quick-start guide

1. Clone this GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/maxwellreuter/game.git`

2. Get the Eclipse IDE to manage Java code (try `www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages`).

3. Open Eclipse and do `File -> Open Projects from File System...`, then navigate to the `GameEngine` folder, select it, and confirm.

4. Configure your Eclipse project starting in the `game` directory as done here: `https://youtu.be/Jdkq-aSFEA0?t=86`. It may be a bit tricky to get Eclipse to recognize the library properly.

5. Run `ValidateSetup.java`. If a window pops up, everything's working!
